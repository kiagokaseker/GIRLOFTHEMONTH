		<p class="pabout">Girl Of The Month is the concept of a fanzine i created with my big brains thinking i was super creative while trying to cheat on a project. 50 creative days was proposed by our professor as a way to work on our creativity. it consisted on doing the same thing through 50 consecutive days. by day 33 i was out of ideas and cheated doing these magazine covers and now here i am making a whole website for them.</p>
